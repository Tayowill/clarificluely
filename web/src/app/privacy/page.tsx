            Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) applies to
            services provided by Clarifi (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;Clarifi&quot;) and

            sign-up flows, or other digital products that link to or reference this Policy
            (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;). It explains what information we collect from
            users of our Services (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;), including information that
            may identify you (&quot;Personal Information&quot;), and how we use it.
          </p>

          <p>
            We encourage you to read this Policy carefully. It applies to any visitor to or user of our
            Services. We may update this Policy from time to time by posting a revised version on this
            page and, where appropriate, notifying you by email. Continued use of the Services after
            changes become effective means you accept the updated Policy.

          <h2 id="scope">Scope and Applicability</h2>
          <p>
            This Policy applies when you visit our website, join our waitlist, use our desktop app, or
            otherwise use the Services. Where we process Personal Information on behalf of business
            customers as a processor (or &quot;service provider&quot;), the customer&apos;s privacy
            notice governs that processing and you should contact them directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Policy does not apply to third-party services you connect to Clarifi (such as Google
            sign-in, Stripe, or meeting platforms). Those services are governed by their own terms and
            privacy policies. Our Site may also contain links to other websites that we do not control.

            the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the Services you request or to take steps at your

          <h2 id="transfers">International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            Clarifi is operated from Spain. Some of our service providers may process data in countries
            outside the EEA, including the United States. Where Personal Information is transferred
            internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards as required by GDPR, such as the
            European Commission&apos;s Standard Contractual Clauses and supplementary measures where
            needed.

            We use cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed in, remember preferences,

          <p>
            We retain Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Services, comply with
            legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When data is no longer
            required, we delete or anonymize it unless retention is required by law or for legitimate
            backup and security purposes.
